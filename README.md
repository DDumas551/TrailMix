Welcome to Project 1! This is an important step in your full-stack journey as you will now use your newly acquired skills and knowledge to build web application from scratch. With your team, you will conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. Because you will be working collaboratively, you will learn agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using the git branch workflow and pull requests.

Working as a group we assigned areas for each of us to work on divided by front end and backend sides. Two assigned to work on the backend while one was assigned to work on the front end. Using multiple server-side APIs including geo-location, weather, and trail heads. Also, includes a review form at the end of the application where data is stored within Firebase.
